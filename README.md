- 1.13
  - ðŸ”©HIGH COMPLEXITY. Need a way to programatically determine which Access Key to remove
- 1.14

- 1.16
  - ðŸ”©HIGH COMPLEXITY. Involves removing the default 'AdministratorAccess' policy from all users, groups, and Roles
- 1.17
  - ðŸ”©HIGH COMPLEXITY. COMPLEX but probably do-able. Need to create a new support role.
- 2.1.3
  - ðŸ”©HIGH COMPLEXITY. You must use your 'root' account to enable MFA Delete on S3 buckets.
- 3.4
  - ðŸ”©HIGH COMPLEXITY. Need a way to ensure the values for "--cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn" and "--cloud-watch-logs-role-arn" are specific to the respective region
- 3.7
  - ðŸ”©HIGH COMPLEXITY. Need to add this command: "aws kms put-key-policy" for each CloudTrail for each Region. Need to apply a pretty complex policy.

  - âš  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52683015/how-to-get-list-of-all-child-elements-with-field-from-parent 
- 3.10 & 3.11
  - âš  Had trouble finding the S3 buckets that were missing their respective policy. Worked around by just applying "All"(Read and Write) in single step
- Section 4
  - Assumes 3.1 was already complete
  - Probably an opportunity to have a single block and loop (instead of 15 distinct blocks) because they are very similar
